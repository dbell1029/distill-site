My name is David Bell and I'm a data scientist from Seattle, Washington/Palmer, Alaska. I love all things data science - data viz, data wrangling, machine learning, statistics, and analytics. I love television and film, music (mainly listening, although I do play), podcasts, sports, tech, and above all, esports.
