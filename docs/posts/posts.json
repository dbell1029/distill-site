    "contents": "\nSome Background\nMy favorite game is Fortnite. Fortnite has a robust competitive community and consequently, there’s loads of tournament data and player statistics that are publicly listed on Fortnite Tracker. But while the data is easy to view, it’s not easy to collect, munge, or explore because their public API doesn’t access competitive data. So to access this data, it needs to be web scraped.\nMy project really has two main parts: 1. A python script that scrapes and stores the data in either a relational database, csv file, or pandas data frame. 2. A dashboard or some series of charts that aptly visualizes the data collected from the event page.\nJust like professional sports, esports are in dire need of data analytics. This will be a great way for me to get my foot in the door in the esports industry.\nDomain(s) to Investigate\nI see two, maybe three domains. First, esports. Second, data science. And third, computer science. Since the vast majority of my free time is spent watching, learning, or playing Fortnite, I have a very solid understanding about the data I’m going to be working with. Most of my time is going to be spent learning how to collect the data, and how I’m going to visualize it in a professional way. And since I’m going to be writing a python script, I’m going to need to learn computer science techniques and practices on how best to scrape the data.\nProposed Deliverables\nMy main deliverable will be the dashboard or visualization that I make after I collect my data. But I can think of a few others if I have the time: * An interactive website, or more likely a page on my blog, that houses the dashboard that I made. * A relational database that contains all of the data I collect. * A machine learning model that predicts the winner of the next major tournament based on results of previous tournaments (and various other factors that I could collect from Fortnite Tracker).\nI’m looking forward to sharing my progress and bringing you along on this journey.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nSypherPK just announced his new apparel brand, Metal Umbrella. Sypher is a world-famous Twitch streamer, YouTuber, and now, fashion icon. While no clothing has been revealed yet, the brand features a heavy anime aesthetic, referencing Sypher’s love for Japanese animation. The first drop - titled “Too Young To Worry” - will be revealed Sunday, August 1st at 11 a.m. Central. It will be available for purchase on Thursday, August 5th.\nThus continues Oni Studios’ ambitious climb towards the top of the esports, entertainment, and live-streaming industries. They specialize in all things content creation, helping creators build their brand, grow their audience, and manage their time and finances. They strive to be everything that was missing in this space: a loyal resource for burgeoning creators.\nI’m so impressed with what Sypher and his team have been able to do in the last year-and-a-half. Covid saw many industries struggle, but Sypher was perfectly posed to take full advantage of the opportunity. Since communities all across the world were in lockdown, people had more free time than perhaps ever before. People were playing more video games, watching more YouTube and Twitch, and Sypher capitalized on this new demographic.\nHis YouTube subscriber base nearly tripled over that time, bringing daily, quality Fortnite content to millions (yes millions) of viewers. This success led to other opportunities, such as new brand partnernships, an exclusive streaming deal with Twitch, and the creation of Oni Studios.\nThe sky’s the limit with this team, I’m excited to see what they do next.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nBenjy played out of his mind yesterday, getting 2nd in the EU tournament with two wins, 13th average placement, and seven average elims. He was two points off winning the tourney, but an absolutely dominant performance nonetheless. Benjy’s gotta be the most likeable pro. He exudes kindness and is just such a wholesome kid. He’s so fun to watch, he’ll probably post a video on his YouTube soon. Benjy’s always been a solo demon, he’s struggled to find huge success in team modes, but I’m hoping this season is different. I’m watching him play the trio cash cup right now and he’s playing well. Fingers crossed.\nXTRA Reet had an amazing day yesterday, winning both the Asia and NA West cash cups. Insane performance. Reet is also a better solo than team player (getting 3rd in FNCS All-Stars last month), but he’s a really good fighter. During the NAW tournament, he got four 1st’s, a 2nd, and a 3rd, with 6 average elims.\nTSM Commandment won the NAE tournament, with TNG Chukky and XTRA Illest getting 2nd and 3rd respectively. Commandment might be the most naturally talented Fortnite player of all time, kid’s insane.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nEU\nChapix, GUILD JannisZ, and GUILD Hen took the crown today in the second trios cash cup of the season, with a whopping five victory royales, 120 elims, and an average placement of 5th, breaking the EU Cash Cup point record in the process. Absolutely dominant performance from the Chapter 2 Season 5 FNCS champions. They didn’t have a great grand finals last season due to being contested off-spawn, but they’ve proved today that they’re still among the best and they’re going nowhere. It’s fun to watch teams with such established chemistry, how their play styles complement each other - it’s a work of art.\nBecome Legends Setty, GAMMA Kami, and Galaxy Racer teeq placed second with four victory royales, a cool 100 elims, and average placement of 9.2. 100 Thieves MrSavage, Falcon Refsgaard, and Nordavind Endretta placed 4th with only one victory royale, but an average placement of 3.3 (a 2nd and three 3rd’s), and 92 eliminations.\nNAE\nSo here’s the deal. Last week, 2019 World Cup solo champion Sentinals Bugha announced that he would be trioing with Chapter 2 Season 4 and 6 winners ENDLESS Deyy and ENLESS Mero, meaning Deyy and Mero would split from their teammate ENDLESS Reverse2k. Why on Earth would they split? They just won FNCS last month, perhaps the first or second most consistent trio in NAE over the last year or so. Deyy and Mero felt said they wanted to trio with an IGL that’s more reliable, not having to rely on solo clutches, so they could win more games. Well, the community was a little upset (for good reason).\nAnyways, after lots of drama, Bugha decided he’d rather stick with his original trio, so that left Deyy, Mero, and Reverse to run it back. Good decision lol. Reverse’s trio won today’s cash cup with two victory royales, 126(!) elims, and an average placement of 9.6. This isn’t surprising at all. Reverse might be the smartest player on NAE, and Deyy and Mero are by far the best fighters alive. Tbh I think Mero might be the best controller player of all time, he performs so incredibly well in big tournaments.\nLuminosity Slackes, 1% Acorn, and G2 Jahq placed 2nd. Ghost Blake, Liquid Scoped, and Tru North Okis placed 3rd, completing an impressive comeback after a few bad games.\nTrio tournaments are looking really good this season - great, balanced meta. I’m happy Epic have finally decided to give competitive a good loot pool. Wish we had daily cups like last Summer though.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nEurope\nFresh off the heels of his third FNCS victory, Falcon TaySon won the 1st solo cash cup of the season in convincing fashion, confirming what the majority of the Fortnite community already knows - that TaySon is far and away the best player alive. He finished with 183 points, two victory royales, and an average placement of 16.2.\nAs awesome as his performance was, I don’t think that was the biggest story of the day. FaZe Mongraal placed 11th , complete with perhaps the most impressive late-game pop off I’ve seen this year. After not qualifying for FNCS Grand Finals two seasons in a row, struggling to find a consistent trio (all while playing the game less than he ever has) Mongraal made a commitment to turn things around, get back on the grind, and strive to be the best. Well, the practice seems to be paying off. Hopefully this is just the beginning of a much deserved comeback.\nNRG benjyfishy, on the other hand, had a less than ideal tournament. He placed 2,647th with two victory royales, but with an average placement of 56.8. I don’t think this is worrisome at all as he placed 5th in the UEFA Euro cup last month, and solos aren’t the main game mode anyway. His attention remains on qualifying for Trio FNCS and hopefully, finally, winning the Axe of Champions.\nNorth America East\nDL Justice won comfortably with 184 points, three victory royales, and average placement of 36.4. His worst placement of the day was an 88th place, but three 1st’s and a 2nd was enough to win him the tournament - racking up 38 eliminations along the way.\n1% Acorn, Tragix, and FaZe Dubs placed 3rd, 4th, and 5th respectively. Tragix has been seeing quite a bit of success in solo tournements, placing 5th in the FNCS All-Star Showdown grand finals. Same story for Dubs who placed just below Tragix, getting 5th. Dubs and Tragix have been playing out of their minds recently and I’m excited to see if they can capitalize once Trio FNCS kicks off in the coming weeks.\nThe story for NAE cash cups remains the same - a European player(s) will play very aggressively, shoot to the top of the leaderboard, but refuse to play for end game, leaving the door wide open for North American players to take the lead. This happens almost every tourney. Yes, EU has the better, smarter, more mechanical players - but they just get impatient playing on East. Doesn’t help playing on 80 plus ping either…\nSolos\nI’ve always been a bigger fan of solo tournaments than team-based tournaments. I play a lot of solos myself, so I find the gameplay more fun to watch. It’s a shame we won’t get any bigger solo tourneys for the forseeable future as trios is the main game mode for the remainder of the year. I’d also like to see some more high-profile duo and squads tournaments as trios are getting a bit stale, but Fortnite’s Fortnite and I’ll watch every tournament no matter what.\n\n\n\n",
